# Platform to Assess Transportation, Health, and Sustainability (PATHS).

A set of scripts to process DynusT trajectories to compute tailpipe
emissions and the dispersion of PM2.5

### Directory structure (for more detailed instructions for using the
    scripts in each directory, please refer to the README.md in that
    directory)

`DynusTparser`: code to read DynusT `output_vehicle.dat` and
`VehTrajectory.dat` toghether with a `links.csv` which defines the
network and output VMT for every link in the network sliced by
arbitrarty time intervals, vehicle type, and speed.
